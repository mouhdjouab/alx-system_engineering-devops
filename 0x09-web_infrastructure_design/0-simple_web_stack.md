Description:

This basic web infrastructure serves as the host for a website accessible via www.foobar.com, lacking firewalls or SSL certificates to safeguard the server's network. Within this setup, components such as the database and application server share resources, including CPU, RAM, and SSD, provided by a singular server.

Specifics About This Infrastructure:

Server Definition:
A server, whether in terms of hardware or software, functions to provide services to other computers, commonly referred to as clients.

Role of the Domain Name:
The domain name serves as a human-friendly alias for an IP address, mapping to the IP address through the Domain Name System (DNS). For instance, www.wikipedia.org is easier to recall than its corresponding IP address, 91.198.174.192.

DNS Record for www.foobar.com:
The DNS record used for www.foobar.com is an A record, as verified by running the command dig www.foobar.com. This type of record, known as an Address Mapping record, associates a hostname with its corresponding IPv4 address.

Web Server's Role:
The web server, be it software or hardware, accepts requests through HTTP or HTTPS, responding with the requested content or an error message.

Application Server's Role:
The application server is responsible for installing, operating, and hosting applications and associated services, catering to end users, IT services, and organizations. It facilitates the hosting and delivery of high-end consumer or business applications.

Database's Role:
The database maintains an organized collection of information, ensuring easy access, management, and updates.

Communication Protocol:
Communication between the server and the client (user's computer) occurs over the internet network, utilizing the TCP/IP protocol suite.

Issues With This Infrastructure:

Single Points of Failure (SPOF):
The infrastructure suffers from multiple Single Points of Failure. For example, if the MySQL database server experiences downtime, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

Downtime During Maintenance:
Maintenance activities on any component necessitate downtime or server shutdown, impacting the website's availability. With only one server, these maintenance windows result in website downtime.

Limited Scalability:
The infrastructure faces challenges in scaling due to the concentration of components on a single server. The server may exhaust resources or slow down when confronted with a surge in incoming traffic, hindering scalability.
