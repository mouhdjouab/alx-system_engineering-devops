Description:

This is a robust 3-server web infrastructure designed with security measures, continuous monitoring, and encryption protocols for serving secure and encrypted traffic.

Specifics About This Infrastructure:

Firewall Purpose:
The firewalls act as a protective barrier for the web servers, preventing unwanted and unauthorized access. By serving as intermediaries between the internal and external networks, they block incoming traffic that matches specific criteria, enhancing network security.

SSL Certificate Purpose:
SSL certificates are employed to encrypt traffic between the web servers and the external network. This encryption safeguards against potential threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) and network sniffing, ensuring privacy, integrity, and identification. SSL certificates play a crucial role in preventing the exposure of valuable information during data transmission.

Monitoring Clients Purpose:
Monitoring clients analyze and assess the performance and operations of servers and the external network. They measure overall health, automatically test server accessibility, gauge response times, and alert administrators if any deviations from expected performance occur. This monitoring tool provides key metrics about server operations, helping administrators identify and address issues promptly, including corrupt or missing files, security vulnerabilities, and various other concerns.

Issues With This Infrastructure:

SSL Termination at Load Balancer:
Terminating SSL at the load balancer level might compromise the security of the traffic between the load balancer and web servers, leaving it unencrypted. Proper encryption protocols need to be maintained throughout the entire communication chain for comprehensive security.

Single MySQL Server:
Relying on a single MySQL server poses scalability challenges and acts as a potential single point of failure for the web infrastructure. Implementing a more scalable and redundant database architecture would enhance the reliability and performance of the overall system.

Uniform Server Components:
The identical components on all servers can lead to resource contention, impacting CPU, memory, I/O, and other resources. This contention may result in poor overall performance and difficulty in pinpointing the source of problems. To improve scalability and performance, a more diversified and scalable setup should be considered, avoiding resource contention and facilitating easier troubleshooting.
